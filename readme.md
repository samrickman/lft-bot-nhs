# NHS Lateral Flow Checker Jan 2022

This is a bot which orders Lateral Flow Tests from the NHS Website.

It requires you to enter your NHS-registered username and password, and it does the rest for you.

It runs on your local machine and the code can be viewed, so you can see it is not harvesting passwords (or even email addresses) if you are so inclined.

### Requirements

You must:

- Have an NHS-registered account.
- The account must have an address registered to it (this will automatically be the case if you have ordered tests online before).
- Currently only available for Windows.

### Installation
