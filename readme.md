# NHS Lateral Flow Checker Jan 2022

This is a bot which orders Lateral Flow Tests from the NHS Website.

It requires you to enter your NHS-registered username and password, and it does the rest for you.

It runs on your local machine and does not send your email address or password anywhere except to the NHS website. Check the source if you are so inclined.

### Requirements

You must:

- Have an NHS-registered account.
- The account must have an address registered to it (this will automatically be the case if you have ordered tests online before).
- Currently only available for Windows.
